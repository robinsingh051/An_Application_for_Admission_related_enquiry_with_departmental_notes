# An Android Application for Admission related enquiry with departmental notes

Admission enquiry is a hectic task for the parent who has a query as well as for the institution. As the parent 
has to reach out to the specific department of the college for these types of queries and the college has to assign 
someone to address these queries. Thus one of the aspects of this project is to give automatic and accurate 
responses to these queries. In implementing this, the parent need not come to college and the college is not 
required to appoint someone. Usually, faculties share the module notes after completing the module so students 
have to wait for them to share the notes to start preparing for the exams. So this project also focuses on building 
a centralized notes distribution system so that every student can access any of the departmental notes anytime.
